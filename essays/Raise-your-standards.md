Maintaining standards, whether in life or in programming, is the key to success. When writing a program, in any language, it is important to keep in mind the basic
coding standards. When solving a problem both the clean and the messy code can compile successfully and give the required results. But if we were to maintain a 
large codebase like Google (discussed [here](https://jaiswal-aditi.github.io/essays/The-multiverse-of-SE.html)), running multiple applications and requiring updates
once every few years, which one do you think would be easy to work with? I hope you say the clean one! A clean code complying to coding standards make development,
addition of new features and debugging easy, and also reduces the maintenance code.

Maintaining standards, whether in life or in programming, is the key to success. When writing a program, in any language, it is important to keep in mind the basic
coding standards. The solution to a problem can be obtained by both the clean and the messy code with its successful compilation. For now I'm just working on small projects but if we were to maintain a  large codebase like Google (discussed [here](https://jaiswal-aditi.github.io/essays/The-multiverse-of-SE.html)), or run multiple applications which requires updates once every few years, which one do you think would be easy to work with? I hope you say the clean one! A clean code complying to coding standards make development, readability, maintenance and debugging much easier. I am used to Python now and those familiar with the syntax know that if one were to use a code block of conditional statement or loops or function, you either have to leave 4 blank spaces to indent the code or Python will automatically do that for you. I used to get annoyed by this because initially I'll always get an error because of indentation issue. And I remember once a friend of mine saw my code and started laughing about why I leave spaces in the code blocks and I replied in a high-fashion manner saying: "this is is code ethics", (when I clearly meant coding standard format). Clearly, I was confused between the terms coding ethics and coding standards and I didn't pay any attention then. But since then I have come to understanding that this annoying thing is actually very helpful because the next time if I or someone else is trying to read and debug my code, it is so much easier to read (and feels good by not seeing any clutter). So, when I started coding in Javascript for this class I was so habitual with the indentation that I will automatically hit the tab button as soon as I was inside a code block! That sure looks good.

### IntelliJ IDEA (indeed a brainy idea by JetBrains)

As we are progressing through the semsester we are also trying to merge different applications. So we are not limited to just solving some WODs (discussed [here](https://jaiswal-aditi.github.io/essays/Is-Javascript-my-karma.html)), but also learn to use right tools (editors, IDE) and platform (GitHub) to store our work, which I'll be using some day in future after I get a good job (^wink ^wink). And so we have started with IntelliJ IDEA, an integrated development environment, used for software development. I have never used this before so I am excited to learn more about this and for now it seems really nicely organized environment. There was a fun activity hosted by our professor so as to declare the key binding shortcut champion and I didn't do well in that but I can see how those can make our lives much easier. Using key binding shortcuts for any editor or IDE or platform is good to learn because you can do things fastly. (Fun fact: I used to feel so smart after learning the Linux commands lines but it also made working with the system simpler.) 

### Making IntelliJ more intelligent with ESLint

ESLint is a pluggable code analysis tool to easily maintain your code and stick to coding standards while getting fewer errors. It is easy to

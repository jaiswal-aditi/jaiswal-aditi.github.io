## Overview

Often times a new incoming student doesn't have much idea about the outdoor activities he/she can do and it can get pretty intimidating living at a new 
place without exploring the fun side of it. Also, Hawaii is kind of expensive when it comes to tourism so we came up with an idea to build an app which
could help students with that. For now this is only for UH students (all 10 campus), where after logging in they can see if other students have posted 
about any fun activity they are planning to do. These activity could be something related to hiking, eating out, sports and recreation, academic. So let's 
say someone who has been living in Hawaii for a while and probably has a car posts about their plan to do Koko Head hike. It can be very exhausting to take
bus to everywhere which is why the other students who don't have a car, who are new to the city, who are looking for new friends can submit a form showing 
their interest in that activity around the same time (as posted by the owner). They can then contact later and do the activity together. This would become 
more helpful when it comes to renting a car, as the expenses get divided between multiple people and the whole trip can become very economic.
We have an idea of adding suggestions from the user wherein they can submit the places they'd like to go and if somebody else is interested as well and can
organize it, it'd be good.

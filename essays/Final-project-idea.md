## Overview

**The problem**: Often times, new students coming to the island are overwhelmed by the transition and they do not get a chance to explore the island to relax their mind. Being ranked as one of the most expensive state in the US does not help ease student’s worry and homesickness either. O‘ahu has lot of places to dine in, hike, sports and recreation, or even study. It would be great if new students are aware of all these places and can make the most out of their time on the island. They can embrace Aloha, without worrying or feeling overwhelmed for coming to the island.

**The solution**: How much better will the students feel exploring the island and doing fun activities with other fellow students. And even better, if they can use a convenient web app that does all the hard work of connecting students to their peers, for you. They can also participate in various student created events all in one single webpage. Students who have been living on the island can create events for incoming students to meet new people, make friends and do the outdoor activities in an economic price range.

**Use**: For example, someone wanted to hike Koko Head and creates an event on the website with a range of dates that is convenient for them. Now other students with similar interest can see the event and join that person. They can either carpool or the latter can get a ride in the former's car or if there's any other event involving multiple days they could rent a car. This is helpful in making the whole trip economic as students can share the cost of renting a car (or a gas if one of them has a car) among themselves. And meeting new people is a bonus!


## Mockup page ideas

1. Login Page
2. Landing Page
3. Navbar (drop down menu of events)
4. Footer
5. Calendar Page 

## Use Case

The new user logs in and looks for the specific event section they are interested in. They can then see the events posted by other people and the dates they are available and if it matches with the new user's interest they can submit a form and schedule it.

## Beyond the basics

1. Can extend this idea to plan a trip to other islands

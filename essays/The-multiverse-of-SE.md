Welcome to GCU (Google Coding Universe) and this essay will walk you through my review on an ACM tech talk `"Software Enineering at Google"`. In this talk, featuring two senior software engineers at Google, the main focus of discussion was what are some best coding practice required to maintain a healthy codebase at Google. Now I always used to correlate software engineering directly with programming and I used to think if you can code well, you'll get a good job. But this was an eye opener for me and it was through this talk I learned that software engineering is so much more than that. It is a team effort, years of experience, observations, ability to evolve with time along with what I used to think the most important thing was. One should also know that there's no 1 solution for all, no silver bullet or no 1 language or a tool which could make development easier and better. Development is a series of small steps which could be achieved not just by fcusing on productiity but also on error budget, risk tolerance and new features. So this is the secret of Google's success.

### Tick tick, boom

The first key point was **time**.

Welcome to GCU (Google Coding Universe) and this essay will walk you through my review on an ACM tech talk `"Software Enineering at Google"`. In this talk, featuring two senior software engineers at Google, the main focus of discussion was what are some best coding practice required to maintain a healthy codebase at Google. Now I always used to correlate software engineering directly with programming and I used to think if you can code well, you can be a good developer. But this was an eye opener for me in a way that it was through this talk I learned that software engineering is so much more than that. It is a team effort, years of experience, observations and ability to evolve with time along with good programming skills. One should also know that there's no 1 solution to all, no silver bullet or no 1 language or a tool which could make development easier and better. Software development is a series of small steps which could be achieved not just by focusing on productiity but also on error budget, risk tolerance and new features. So this is the secret of Google's success.

### Tick tick, boom

The first key point was **time**. You may ask how does time affect a project? The speaker gave a very concise explanation: for a novice programmer, working on a specifiic project, the project time is measured in hours (or maybe days). Then comes the startups or app development codes which is based on specific needs and may work upto 2-3 years. Finally on a bigger scale we have tech industry projects (Linux, Google), open source development which have a long lifespan of decades probably. You don't just throw away your code but upgrade it, make it sustainable and compatible. `"Software engineering is the art of making your program resilient to change over time."` And how does Google do that? I'll give you a hint: sustainability. We know that change is the only constant in life. So with time we are geeting better tools, upgraded software, hardware and new technology and if we keep on discarding each of our previous codebase it'll cost us a fortune. Well, that's where Google understood its homework correctly. It includes large scale change refactoring. Let's put it this or as they call it "Hyrum's law". No, its not a famous, standardized concept but rather an observation:

> *"with sufficient users in API, it doesnâ€™t matter what you promise in contract: all observable behaviors of a system depend on someone."*

Let's break it down. We don't always know what users want and we can't focus on their specific needs because that will change with time, and dealing with all of them separately is too complicated. So we need to incorporate randomness in the codebase to make it resilient to the change, and be easily able to upgrade and maintain it. Sustainability means you are able to change all of the things that you ought to change, safely. This is because, in software engineering, the goal is not to just solve problems but keep the solutions working for as long as possible.

### Scale the sale!

As mentioned before, hardware (CPU, RAM), software and human resources, everything that your code relies on, is changing everyday. So the question a developer should ask is *"are those  **scalable** in terms of cost and resource consumption?* With the ever increasing user requests how can one handle the codebase without affecting the throughput? Now the traditional way to do this would be introducing upgrades by deprecating old versions and mandating new ones or burdening one person to handle this. But that's now how you do things at Google and it's not the smart way. When you hire some top-level, skimmed, smart engineers you don't pay them to just broadcast messages and linearly increase the cost and resources. But you make use of the expertise and knowledge of the team, a rather simple and cheap option using sub-linearly scaling resources. Google has adopted a smart way to divide the codebase management in teams, focusing on specific applications. This saves the communication overhead, and when navigating through the software development process these engineers, due to their familiarity with the codebase, will come up with a better solution to the problem.

An example was provided to explain this scenario. When discussing 'git merge meetings', where developers meet up before a merge occurs, the developers came up with a way to handle merge conflicts called 'trunk-based development'. This means you are merging small, new feature updates, bug fix or other small changes in the codebase to streamline integration process and increase organizational performance.

### Tradeoffs

This is a factor which is easy to overlook but may cause disaster. Software engineering does not just work on your gut feeling but you need to consider data driven decisions to acoount for real-time issues. One must re-evaluate their decisions, with appropriate reasons, and take in context the evidence from previous software updates before designing, developing and deploying a new software. The presenter also talked about the intermediate steps that goes through before the product is released and "bugs will always slip through". Here comes the need for tradeoffs. One must decide if they want to take more time to focus on development and fix bugs before releasing the product to users or do they want to make it available to users for AB testing and meanwhile, based on the user feedbacks, fix bugs in the later stage and maybe spend more. Software designing is a long term process which necessitates the use of **evidence based decisions.** 

## So, what's the secret?

My the most important takeway from this talk was how software engineering is a much larger process and programming is just a tiny (but important) part of it. This gave me an insight into how big tech companies, like Google, are successfully trending up with the technologies and ruling the market. And I feel like as a software engineer it is important to take note of these points. The development process is hugely impacted by time because they are here for the long-run and one can't just discard millions of lines of code so as to serve to new requirements but you should be able to keep up with the changes. And this may never occur to us in the first go but the same software (or rather the hardware generating that software) is also leaving its carbon footprint, which is why just like in the case of ecological health, sustainability is the key for a healthy codebase. For now, I may be working on many smaller projects to comply with my academic requirements, but I aim to focus more on the future implications of those projects. And since this talk became a part of the evidence, I intend to use this for my next data driven decision to come up with a sustainable, mindful solution to my research work.

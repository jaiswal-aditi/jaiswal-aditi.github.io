Computer Science is indeed a very broad field covering programming languages, software tools, different branches like artificial intelligence, human computer
interaction but it is always evolving. There's always a new tool, a new update, a new language available for us to learn and use. And with that increases the 
confusion as well. As a newbie in software engineering, I am learning that it is very important to find the bug on your own (or at least attempt for that) before 
bugging others to find the solution. With that being said, it is also important to know what the problem is, what the topic is and what question should one ask? 
Luckily I found this [guide](http://www.catb.org/esr/faqs/smart-questions.html) by Eric Steven Raymond, before I could embarass myself by asking "stupid" questions.

## ~~Mirror mirror on the wall~~ Computer desktop in the study hall, am I dumb after all?

Sure enough, in high school, we are encouraged to ask whatever doubts we have, or we are being told no questions are stupid. But is that really true though?
When you are a software developer, a researcher or, in my case, a graduate student, one should understand that they are not entitled to an answer for their questions. 
Just because your code didn't work or a library threw an error in the code doesn't mean you should straight up ask someone for help. Instead, this is a great time to
think about the problem, go through the basics, search the answer on Web or respective forum, discuss the problem with your friend, analyze how they are approaching 
the problem. And if nothing works, then ask your professor or an expert. One of the surprising and possibly the best thing I learned from Raymond's article is 
*experts will be able to tell from your questions how much reading and thinking you did, and will be more willing to help if you come prepared.* (This is the reason
I gave my essay the title it has.) There are a plethora of web forums out there, with people asking all sorts of questions and it is interesting to note that some 
questions are more likely to get a response than others. And that reason is your ability to concisely explaining the issue you are facing, what did you do about it,
what errors you encountered while doing that, what platform are you working on, correct grammar. Shocking right! So yes, if we still asking questions like `Help! This
app is not working on my phone/laptop.`, then yes maybe we are dumb after all.

## What's "smart?"



## What's "not smart?"

Say, a question like [this](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/41367541/python-is-not-running). One might say maybe he just started with a programming language
and isn't very familiar with the functionality. Fair enough. But if we notice, he didn't mention what platform he is working on, what the notebook model is, what
error pops out on the screen (somebody already mentioned that the question is somewhat vague) or did he follow the instructions from the user guide or the official 
documentation correctly? In response to this question, a reference to another [question](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/3701646/how-to-add-to-the-pythonpath-in-windows-so-it-finds-my-modules-packages)
was posted and we can immediately notice the difference between the two questions asked. The latter explains the problem more clearly and concisely, explains the 
steps he took and what error he got which shows that he knew what to do but didn't know how? We are humans, and yes we make mistakes and miss out on few things and 
that is okay as long as you attempted to solve your problem and didn't demand for a solution to be shared with you.


The "experts" or "hackers" or "professional developers"

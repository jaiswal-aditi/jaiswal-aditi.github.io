Phew!!! The semester is over and that concludes my journey as a software developer (for now). Am I going to rise from ashes? Only time will tell, but for now I'm going to write about my learning from this class. 
  
This course was like riding a roller-coaster, something which I have literally never experienced in my life. I still remember contacting multiple graduate students before enrolling in this class as I was really scared that I'd make a complete fool of myself. But I'm glad I took the risk because what a rewarding journey this was! ICS613 as a subject introduced me to the corporate world of web development, software engineering and team work (yes, software engineering is also about those soft skills). Over the course of the semester I learned many concepts, starting with basic Javascript, then switching gears into UI/UX (Semantic UI, React), database (MongoDB) and finally coming a full circle with agile project management. 
  
### Software Engineering is not just sitting in front of your computer and coding (blindly)
  
Other than the technical knowledge, this is my biggest takeaway from this course as it completely changed the notion in my head.

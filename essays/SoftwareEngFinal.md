Phew!!! The semester is over and that concludes my journey as a software developer (for now) or am I going to rise from ashes? 
  
This course was like riding a roller-coaster ride for me, something which I have literally never experienced in my life. I still remember contacting
multiple graduate students before enrolling in this class as I was really scared that I'd make a fool of myself. But I'm glad I took it and what a journey this was! ICS613 as a subject introduced me to the corporate world of web development, software engineering and team work. Over the course of the semester I learned many concepts, starting with basic Javascript, then switching gears into UI/UX (Semantic UI, React), database (MongoDB) and finally coming a full circle with agile project management. 
  
### Software Engineering is not just sitting in front of your computer and coding (blindly)
  
That's my biggest takeway from this course.

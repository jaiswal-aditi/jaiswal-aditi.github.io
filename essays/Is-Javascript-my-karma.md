## Is Javascript my Karma ?

There’s a saying which goes “what goes around, comes around”, a metaphor for karma. Well in my case my karma was software engineering. So, here’s my story….
I have to admit, choosing to learn a programming language over cramming some information about different sports is one of the best things I did in my high school. I know it sounds weird but that was in our curriculum. Anyways, out of my class of 100 students, 7 of us chose to learn C++. Yes, that’s how I started my “coding journey”. And I remember, at one point of time, I wanted to be a software engineer because I really enjoyed programming and wanted to learn more, a lot more. But everyone discouraged me saying it’s a very “traditional, low-paying job which involved working in a company and would only suit men”! Shocking right? Well I wasn’t mature enough to understand all these things and coming from a middle class Indian family and being a girl child you always think “my parents know better”. So somehow I ended up studying Physics and as much as I enjoyed learning about the mysteries of the Universe, I felt like something was missing. I did a couple of research internships during my undergraduate studies and unconsciously I ended up doing some computational simulations for my work and using some programming languages. Then, fortunately I got an amazing opportunity to work at CERN and it was there I learnt about Machine Learning and decided this is what I want to do. Fast forward to today, I am pursuing another Masters in Computer Science and more specifically, a software engineering course! A new programming language is being added in my “cognitive memory” (I’m trying to make some lame references to computer science) and that is Javascript. So, in short I left my dream to pursue computer science for others and now I’m back at it again, for myself, thanks to ICS613 and Javascript. 

## function isJavascriptFun (thoughts) {\
##    if (thoughts == ‘enjoy’) {\
##        console.log(“We are off to a great start”);\
##    } else {\
##        console.log(“Well, give it some time woman!”);\
##      }\
## }\

Since I have just started with this language, it is kind of hard to tell if this is a good language or not. Because I’m so used to Python now, sometimes I forget you need parentheses to define a function! Funny right? But what I mean to say is that there’s a syntactical difference between Python and Javascript, which at some point is good (you don’t have to specifically declare different data structures) and other times is a bit annoying. The ES6 version of Javascript looks very cool with some advanced features like object.freeze, destructuring, promises (you can relate them to real-life experiences). I’ll get a hang of it and resources like “freeCodeCamp” are really proving to be useful so I really look forward to other modules. But one thing I have learnt so far is that you only need 3 things to become a good software engineer- coding practice, coding practice and coding practice. Sorry, just kidding. There are other important requirements too like getting a degree, making yourself better in reading and writing (technical essays are a bonus) etc. (I’m still learning other important points and once I find those out, I’ll update it here). For now, to cover the ‘practice part’ let’s move on to the next section.

## Exercise

You’d probably say: wait, you mean coding exercise right? I’d say yes and no. No, because I learnt another important thing in this class is that it is also important to focus on your physical and spiritual health to improve your thought process, problem solving approach and coding skills. And yes, because that is covered by WODs. WOD (or workout of the day) is something Professor Johnson came up with as a part of athletic software engineering. Here, a problem is given and we are supposed to finish coding it within a time interval. This approach does put on some pressure and honestly I’m a bit scared about it but I feel like in the long run these will prove to be helpful. As this is my first ever software development class, this workout will help me prepare myself for the technical interviews, for which I have watched many videos and have always dreaded about. 

To conclude, I’m excited to have 2 workout sessions (physical exercise and coding assignment). And as much as both are going to be stressful, tough and dreadful sometimes, it will be a fun experience, and if I am consistent enough I will have a good life (and hopefully a good job too)!

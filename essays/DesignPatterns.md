### Vanilla CSS vs (other flavoured) CSS frameworks

You ever look at a few beautifully designed websites, compatible with all browsers and wonder how much effort was put into those? I did and I used to

to do the same thing. And that's the logic of the logical CSS frameworks, to make your life easy. Semantic UI is one such framework which provides all the 
components, integrated with HTML and CSS, a developer might need which can be accessed through classes. But wait, that does not mean you should directly
jump into that.

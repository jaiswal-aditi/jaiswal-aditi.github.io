Do you enjoy food? I do. A lot. I love trying new dishes, restaurants and this experimentation led me to select few of the dishes or restaurants as my favorite ones. I also love watching cooking videos, especially the ones where they give you small tips which can make your food taste good and cooking easier. And that's because they are **experienced** people, who have **tried those specific tips and tricks** and it proved to be useful for them for that dish. They might have also tried **different methods** or even **different dishes** with the same approach and found an optimal way to get the tastiest food. Now I also like to cook those recipes, at home, in a procedural way as they explained. What I'll do, any guesses? Yeah, I'm going to follow that recipe, with the specified measurements of ingredients, step-by-step. If you use the above bold words and somehow put it together you get the motivation behind design patterns.

### The old grandfather's advice

Design patterns are like old-age, experienced grandfather's advice, a time-tested solution to common problems. They have faced the same issues in their time and by different trial and error methods or using someone else's advice they found a way to solve it. And now they are just trying to pass that information onto us so we don't have to go through the rigorous process again but instead focus on our productivity for the bigger problem. Simple, right? But the reason I sighed is because I was expecting this to be a complex, hi-fi, 'techie' topic only to realize this is a very basic idea of making solutions to common problems available for everyone. And this is a reason to sigh because I have been using this in this class, in my small development journey, without even knowing that this is what I have been doing. Starting from architectural field, this 'problem-driven-approach' made its way into software engineering because it makes code reusable and a developer's life easy as they don't have to build everything from scratch. 


### The technicality in design patterns

There are different types of design patterns in software engineering, providing a vocabulary for software development discussion and can be broadly classified as creational, structural and behavioral. 

Creational pattern is more about classic class-object design. These are further subcategorized in other design patterns based on the difference between inheritance in class instantiation and delegation in object creation, but we will not be discussing that here. Structural design uses class and object composition to obtain new functionality. And finally behavioral design patterns identify the communication between objects of the classes.

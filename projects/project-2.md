summary: This was my Master thesis project at CERN, Geneva, where I was trying to simulate and detect a heavy neutral lepton with the ATLAS detector using a final state that features dileptons and hadrons.

Despite being one of the most successful theories of the past century the `Standard Model (SM)` also has its flaws, unable to explain the baryon asymmetry, neutrino masses, dark matter and dark energy. In this work, a preliminary study was performed to see whether it is possible to detect a heavy neutral lepton (HNL), with the ATLAS detector, using a final state that features dileptons and hadrons. HNLs can be produced in the decay of a W boson to a lepton and a neutrino, where the neutrino oscillates into the heavy neutral lepton. Experimentally, it is well established that the relativistic flavour neutrinos &\nu<sub>L</sub> (or anti-neutrinos $\bar{&nu<sub>L</sub>}$) are always produced in left-handed LH (or right-handed RH) dominant weak interaction processes, which are described by a chiral LH field in SM. Since neutrinos have no charge there is a postulate of RH anti-neutrino being neutrino’s CPT and Lorentz partner, which gives them four degrees of freedom: the left and right-handed neutrinos and the left and right-handed anti-neutrinos. But these RH neutrinos &\nu<sub>R</sub> interact very weakly with the matter and are “sterile” or “inert” in nature. When they decay into another lepton and a quark-antiquark pair (which then hadronises), a final state featuring two charged leptons and a hadron is arrived at. A search targeting this final state was performed for this thesis, which has a signature of displaced vertex and thus the event selection was optimised in such a way so as to maximise the efficiency for the semi-leptonic decay mode and minimise the background levels.

Since this is still an ongoing research at CERN and its collaborations with other researchers, I can't provide any source code but I am happy to dicuss more about this work. My contributions in this research was doing data analysis and simulating the event.
